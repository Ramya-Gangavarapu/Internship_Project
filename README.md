## Real-Time Vehicle Detection using OpenCV

Welcome to the Real-Time Vehicle Detection project, where we leverage the power of OpenCV's computer vision capabilities to detect various types of vehicles in video streams. This project showcases the implementation of Haar cascade classifiers to identify two-wheelers, buses, and cars in real-time videos.

## Project Highlights
Taken a sample dataset and applied the following steps.
- **Accurate Detection:** Our project employs Haar cascade classifiers, a powerful method for object detection, ensuring high accuracy in identifying vehicles within the video stream.

- **Real-Time Processing:** The utilization of OpenCV's efficient algorithms enables real-time processing of video frames, allowing us to detect vehicles on-the-fly as they appear.

- **Multi-Vehicle Detection:** This project covers a diverse range of vehicles, including two-wheelers, buses, and cars, making it suitable for various scenarios and applications.

- **User-Friendly Interaction:** We've designed the user interface to be intuitive and interactive. Simply input the video file, and the program will showcase the detection process with visualizations.


## Getting Started

To run the vehicle detection, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
3. Provide the path to the video file in the respective sections of the code.
4. Run the Python script and observe the real-time vehicle detection in action.


## Future Enhancements

We're actively working on expanding the project's features, including:

- Adding more vehicle types to the detection, such as trucks and pedestrians.
- Implementing advanced object tracking algorithms for smoother detection in challenging scenarios.
- Developing a web-based interface for real-time vehicle detection via webcam.

Stay tuned for updates and improvements as we continue to evolve this project.
